                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi and welcome to my website. My name is Danielle Beckley, but most people call me Dani. I'm a 5th year studying Computer Science and Engineering at Ohio State, graduating in December 2016. If you explore this site, you'll see some of my experience in and knowledge of the CSE world; here I'll tell you a bit more about myself outside the world of programming. </p>
                
                <p>I love exploring. The greatest advice I've ever received is to always be uncomfortable; I find this to still be relevant and motivational every single day.  I push myself to explore, discover, and create new things (applicable to both programming and the world). I love being outdoors, everything from hiking to laying around at the beach. This summer, I've spend my time laying out and reading at beautiful Lake Michigan as well as exploring so many beautiful places. Below is one of the many beautiful places I visited this summer in Wisconsin called the Lion's Den Gorge Nature Preserve.</p>

                <p> I really enjoy working out. I have been doing Kayla Itsines' BBG Workout for 22 weeks now! I am super proud not only of the time I've committed to this workout, but also the mental and physical changes. Working out helps to clear my mind and overall be a more positive person.</p>
                <img class="hobby-photo" src="images/about/workout.jpg" alt="Workout Photo">
                <p>Learning new things is important to me, so I spend a lot of time listening to podcasts and watching documentaries. Some of my favorites include Winter on Fire, Stuff You Should Know Podcast, Serial Podcast, TED Radio Hour Podcast, Planet Money Podcast, and The Monday Morning Podcast. </p>
                <p>As is obvious by the fact that I love exploring, I love having new experiences. One way I often do this is by going to comedy shows and concerts. My favorite venue thus far has been Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. I've been fortunate enough to see two conerts there: Walk the Moon and John Mayer. Below are some of my photos from Red Rocks. </p>

                <p>Last but certainly not least are my family and friends.  I've meet some amazing friends at college and I am very close with my sisters. We explore together whether it is by going to restauraunts, concerts, hiking, or somewhere in between. I am blessed to have shared many experiences and made many memories with them. Below are some of my favorite memories.  </p>
